<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [PES University](https://pes.edu), advised by [Dr. Gowri Srinivasa](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1084/). My research interests lie in efficient machine learning and natural language processing, with a focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, representation engineering, and multilingual language models.

I do research at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, and my broad research objective is bridging the gap between state-of-the-art NLP methods and the diverse communities of potential users who could significantly benefit from these advanced technologies, but for whom practical implementation remains a challenge.

I have gained valuable industry experience through internships at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/site/in/en/index.html) and [Nokia](https://nokia.com), working on distributed systems and practical machine learning applications. I am always excited to collaborate on projects - feel free to [reach out](anirudhlakhotia5@gmail.com) if you'd like to work together!
